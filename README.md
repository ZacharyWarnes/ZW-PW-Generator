# ZW-PW-Generator

## Purpose of This Challenge 

* The purpose of this challenge is to create a password generator using Javascript.

* The excercise requires us to use our learned knowledge of variables, created arrays, functions, comparatives, conditionals, and listener events to create a password generator that will generate a password bewtween 8 and 128 characters. We were to give the user a choice of character type that they will use to generate their password

## How I Have Completed This Challenge 

* I am a new programmer so learning the ins and outs of JS has been difficult, if not rewarding. 

* In order to create a password generator that would use different kinds of characters, I had to create arrays for each different character type (ex: a-z, 0-9, upperCase, lowerCase, etc..). Once these arrays were created, I started create the framework for application in the provided starter code.

* Using conditionals, I created a window alert prompting the user to choose the length of their password and wrote code to display an error message if they did not pick a password length between 8 and 128 characters. 

* Next I declared new variables for each choice the user could make and wrote a conditional that would force the user to choose at least ONE choice (otherwise the password generator would not have a variable array to choose characters from).

* Next I created a combined Concat array for all chosen variables and wrote conditional code to combine all of the user's character-type choices for their password

* Getting a little help from a tutor, I learned how to create a For Loop in order to allow the function to randomly generate chosen characters types to the desired length of the password.

*The remainder of the start code provides me with the listener event "click" to start the function.

## Conclusion

* This excersise has successfully showed me how to create variable arrays and use them inside a working function. 

* I have learned how to write effective conditional statements and use them within the framework of a function so that the function is dynamic and will use user input. 

* I have a new appreciation for web-applications and the complexity and power of Javascript
